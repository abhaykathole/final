      <h3>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h3>

      <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, 
      and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, 
      behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what 
      stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, 
      we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>
      
      <p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that 
      *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies 
      have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture.
      Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

      <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written
      narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. 
      To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, 
      emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>
      
      <p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects 
      used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, 
      and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
